              The XYZ Foundation has been
              working since 2014 with children of the community
              between the ages of 5 and 15 years.
              We are now creating a new group – XYZ Seniors
              which aims at creating a fun, interactive and a creative
              outlet for youth over the age of 15 years.
              This group will create a sense of belonging and pride
              within the community and also provide extra curricular
              activities with social awareness, personality development
              and life skills. There will be fun events, sports, games and
              other activities that are of the youth, by the youth and for
              the youth.
